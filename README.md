# SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services Cookbook
This is the code repository for [SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/sql-server-2016-reporting-services-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781786461810), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter 2.


The code will look like the following:

     [default]
     exten => s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)
     exten => s,2,Voicemail(u100)
     exten => s,102,Voicemail(b100)
     exten => i,1,Voicemail(s0)

### Software requirements: 
To work through the recipes in this book, you will, of course, need a copy of SQL Server 2016. If you donâ€™t have one, Microsoft has now released the SQL Server 2016 Developer Edition as a free download, and it will work just fine for working through the recipes.

You can download the developer edition at:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-developers

or use the shortcut:

http://bit.ly/sql2016dev

In addition, you will want a copy of the brand-new SQL Server 2016 sample database, WideWorldImporters. Specifically, the data warehouse version of the sample, WideWorldImportersDW, was used for the examples in this book. You can find the samples on GitHub, at:

https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/wide-world-importers

or use the shortcut:

http://bit.ly/wwisample

You also need AdventureWorks 2014 multi-dimensional and tabular databases since they were used with some examples. You can find the samples database at: https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/125550
